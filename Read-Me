There are essentially ways to run the program.

Basically all you need to do is to uncomment certain blocks of code in order to run the file.

They will have some soft of headers: Label-1 , Label-2

If you would like to run the Inventory Management Syste, all you need to do is uncomment the code under Label-1, and commment out Label-1 Code.

If you would preform pre-made unit-test, you need uncomment the code that has Label-2, and comment out Label-2 Code.
